### Project Summary

The first project of the bootcamp is designed based on data from the website [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com). The goal of this project is to help you become more familiar with the skills learned in the bootcamp and apply them practically. By collecting data from the website, you will conduct statistical analysis and answer some interesting questions.

The project consists of three main phases:

1. **Data Collection (Web Scraping)**:
   - Use web scraping techniques to collect data such as player name, birth date (age), height, nationality, position, shooting statistics, current club, weight, and more.
   - For teams, gather data such as name, founding date, league name, coach, players, average player age, club value, player value, achievements, and stadium name.

2. **Database Design**:
   - Create a relational database (RDBMS) to store the collected data.
   - Define entities such as players, teams, leagues, and matches, and determine relationships between them (e.g., players and teams).
   - Normalize the data to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.
   - Use an RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, SQLAlchemy) based on scalability and performance needs.
   - Retrieve data from the database for analysis and machine learning model preparation.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Perform descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing on the data, focusing on the NBA league.
   - Analyze player height distribution for those in the Michael Jordan Trophy and compare it to the top 50 players for the 2019-2024 seasons.
   - Compare player experience and height distribution for the champion team versus the top 15 players of the last two seasons.
   - Identify potential players for teams looking to invest in positions that require high basketball IQ, such as Point Guard, based on their inclusion in the Michael Jordan Trophy list.

   **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Validate hypotheses like the effect of height on goal-scoring or the improvement of agility and skills over time.

The project also emphasizes teamwork, soft skills, and communication, with evaluation based on team contributions.

**Bonus Points**:
- Rich documentation and clean code.
- Active participation in Git and contribution to statistical tests.
- Design additional statistical tests, provide useful charts, and create a compelling presentation.

Good luck with the project! ðŸ˜Š
