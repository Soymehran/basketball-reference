    "This script defines a structured database schema for a basketball league using SQLAlchemy ORM. \n",
    "The database consists of multiple related tables representing different entities in a basketball season.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps in the Code:**\n",
    "1. **Import Required Libraries**  \n",
    "   - We use SQLAlchemy to define and manage the database schema.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Define the Base Class for ORM Models**  \n",
    "   - We create a `Base` class using `declarative_base()`, which all our tables inherit from.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Database Tables (Models)**  \n",
    "   - `Player`: Represents players in the league.  \n",
    "   - `Team`: Stores teams in the league.  \n",
    "   - `Season`: Represents different basketball seasons.  \n",
    "   - `Stat`: Holds statistical data for each player in each season.  \n",
    "   - `Champion`: Stores the championship-winning teams for each season.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Define Relationships Between Tables**  \n",
    "   - Players belong to a team (Many-to-One).  \n",
    "   - Stats link players, teams, and seasons (Many-to-One).  \n",
    "   - Champions link teams to seasons (Many-to-One).  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create an SQLite Database and Generate Tables**  \n",
    "   - The `engine = create_engine('sqlite:///basketball.db')` command creates an SQLite database file.  \n",
    "   - `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)` generates the necessary tables in the database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Create a Session for Database Interactions**  \n",
    "   - A session (`session = Session()`) is created to allow inserting, updating, and querying data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of This Design**\n",
    "Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for easier database management.  \n",
    "Follows best practices for defining relational database structures.  \n",
    "Allows easy expansion to support more features in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**By running this script, an SQLite database named `basketball.db` will be created with all the necessary tables.**  \n",
